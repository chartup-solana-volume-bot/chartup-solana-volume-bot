* Review market details before executing any transaction to make informed decisions.

***

#### Wallet Selection

* Click on any wallet to include it in your trading action.
* âœ… **Green icon** = Wallet is selected.
* You may select one or multiple wallets to execute actions in parallel.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: This feature can be used for multi-wallet simulations or synchronized exits.

***

#### Available Actions

Once wallets are selected, the following actions are available:

* **Buy** â€” Purchase tokens from the selected pair.
* **Sell** â€” Sell tokens held in each wallet.
* **Refresh** â€” Update and display the latest wallet balances.

All actions apply to every selected wallet simultaneously.
