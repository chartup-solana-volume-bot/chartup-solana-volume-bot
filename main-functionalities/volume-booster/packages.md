### Disclaimer

Service durations are **estimates** and may vary depending on market conditions, token volatility, and platform performance.

All package calculations are based on **Raydium’s 0.25% swap fee**. Other platforms may apply higher fees (for example, **Pumpfun charges 1%**), which means the same package will generate proportionally less trading volume.

All package outcomes are **estimates only**. Actual results may differ, and performance may be influenced by external market conditions outside of ChartUp’s control.

For a complete overview of responsibilities, usage terms, and restrictions, please review our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.chartup.io/terms-conditions?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
