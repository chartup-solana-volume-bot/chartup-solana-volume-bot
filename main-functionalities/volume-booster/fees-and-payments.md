# Fees & Payments

#### Platform Swap Fees

All package estimations are based on **Raydium’s 0.25% swap fee**. Platforms with higher swap fees—such as **Pumpfun (1%)**—will generate proportionally lower trading volume from the same package. Actual results depend on the pool, market conditions, and external trading activity.

#### Payment Options

Orders can be funded in:

* **Solana (SOL)**
* **Your own Solana token** (ideal for reusing sniped or reserved supply to generate volume without extra SOL spend).

#### Secure Payments

Each user receives a **unique one-time payment address** for every order. We never request wallet connections, private keys, or seed phrases. Payments are handled securely on-chain, ensuring full control and privacy for users.

#### Additional Information

Service outcomes are **estimates only** and may vary depending on market conditions and platform performance. For complete details on usage, responsibilities, and disclaimers, please refer to our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.chartup.io/terms-conditions?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
