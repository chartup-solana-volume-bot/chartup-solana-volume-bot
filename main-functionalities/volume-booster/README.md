# Volume Booster

### Volume Boosting (Tasks)

ChartUp provides automated **volume boosting tasks** that generate trading activity across decentralized exchanges. These tasks can help projects establish early on-chain presence and visibility by distributing trades across multiple wallets and time intervals.

#### How It Works

* Volume tasks execute a sequence of buys and sells designed to resemble standard market activity.
* Each buy originates from a separate wallet, ensuring no single address dominates trading.
* Tasks run continuously according to your allocation settings, creating consistent transaction flow across supported DEXs.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Volume tasks are fully automated. You set the task, and ChartUp manages execution. It is the sole responsibility of the project team to inform their audience about the use of trading automation and to avoid presenting boosted activity in a misleading way.

#### Supported DEXs

ChartUp currently supports volume boosting on:

* Raydium
* LaunchLab
* Bonkfun
* Pumpfun
* PumpSwap
* Meteora
* BelieveApp
* BagsApp
* HeavenDex
* Moonit
* Moonshot

#### Auto Migration

If your token migrates to a new liquidity pool, ChartUp automatically detects the change and redirects trading activity to the new pool, ensuring uninterrupted execution of active tasks.
