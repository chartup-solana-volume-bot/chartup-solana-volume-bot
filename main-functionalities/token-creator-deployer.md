# Token Creator (Deployer)

### Token Creator

Easily mint your own SPL token on Solana by providing a few essential details. The **ChartUp Telegram bot** offers a streamlined interface, making the process simple for both newcomers and experienced users.

#### Required Token Information

To mint a token, you'll need to provide the following:

* **Name**: The full name of your token (e.g., "Solana Coin").
* **Description**: A brief summary of what your token represents.
* **Symbol**: The short identifier for your token (e.g., "SOLC").
* **Image**: A logo or image that represents your token.
* **Total Supply**: The number of tokens to be minted.
* **Mint Wallet**: The wallet that will hold mint authority.\
  You can select an existing wallet or create a new one directly through the ChartUp Telegram bot during the process.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: A wallet can be generated in the ChartUp Telegram bot before starting, or you can create one when prompted to select a wallet for minting.

#### Optional Token Information

Enhance your tokenâ€™s profile with additional details:

* **Website**
* **X (formerly Twitter)**
* **Instagram**
* **Facebook**
* **Other Socials**

#### Minting Fee

* A fee of **0.03 SOL** is required to complete the token minting process.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: This is a standard network fee charged by the Solana blockchain. **ChartUp does not collect any portion of this fee**â€”you are only paying whatâ€™s required to mint the token on-chain. There are no hidden charges or additional platform fees.
