# Token Management

The **Token Management** section displays all tokens you have created through the ChartUp bot. From here, you can view and manage tokens using the following options:

* **Create Liquidity Pool (LP)**
* **Snipe your own token**
* **Burn LP tokens** (if a pool exists)

***

#### View Details

* Select any token to open its **details page**.
* If a liquidity pool exists, you will be able to view pool information and perform actions such as **Burn LP**.
* If no pool has been created yet, you can start the LP creation process directly from this menu.

***

#### Create Liquidity Pool

If your token does not yet have a liquidity pool, you can create one from this menu.

> ðŸ’¡  Note: Creating a liquidity pool is required to make your token tradable on supported DEXs.

***

#### Burn Liquidity Pool (LP) Tokens

If your token already has a liquidity pool, you may choose to burn the LP tokens from this menu. Burning LP tokens will:

* Permanently remove access to those LP funds.
* Demonstrate liquidity commitment and may enable **Raydium Creator Rewards** (subject to Raydiumâ€™s policies).
* Eliminate all future control over the removed LP position.

> ðŸ’¡  Note: burning LP tokens is **irreversible**. Once completed, the tokens cannot be recovered or reclaimed. Please consider this carefully before proceeding.
