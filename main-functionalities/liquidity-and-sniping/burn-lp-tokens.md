# Burn LP Tokens

Burning LP (liquidity provider) tokens is an important step if you want to qualify for **Raydium Creator Rewards**. By burning LP, you permanently lock liquidity, which signals trust and security to both Raydium and your community. This step is one of the requirements to claim **Creator Rewards** from Raydium, which may include incentives such as added visibility, ecosystem support, and reward payouts based on trading activity and liquidity depth.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Burning LP tokens is optional, but strongly recommended for creators who plan to claim Raydium Creator Rewards. Once LP tokens are burned, they are permanently removed and cannot be reclaimed.

#### How to Burn LP Tokens

You can burn your LP tokens at any time directly from the **Token Details** section in the ChartUp Telegram bot. After burning, your project becomes eligible for Raydiumâ€™s reward incentives and also gains more credibility with traders and investors.
