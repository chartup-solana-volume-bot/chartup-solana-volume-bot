# Volume Tasks (Sniped Supply)

### Volume Boosting Tasks

ChartUp lets you launch volume boosting tasks using a portion of your sniped tokens. These tasks simulate organic activity by buying and selling your token across multiple wallets, helping your project gain early traction both on-chain and on analytics platforms.

#### How It Works

* Tokens are gradually allocated across bots to **minimize chart impact**.
* Depending on the total amount, tokens are split into **multiple bots**, each running continuous buy/sell cycles.
* **Every buy is made from a fresh wallet**, creating realistic transaction patterns.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: You can choose how many tokens to allocate. Unused tokens can be kept for future campaigns, smart-sell tasks, or manual strategies.

#### Smart Scaling

As your project gains momentum and bots generate profit from trading, ChartUp automatically splits them into additional botsâ€”boosting both volume and transaction count over time, with no extra input required.

#### Full Control

* Access all active tasks at any time to respond to market conditions or make adjustments.
* Pause tasks instantly if needed.
* Review activity, monitor trades, and fine-tune behavior based on real-time chart performance.
