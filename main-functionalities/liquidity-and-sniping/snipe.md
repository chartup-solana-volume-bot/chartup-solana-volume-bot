# Snipe

### Sniping

**Sniping** allows token creators to purchase their own tokens at launchâ€”before the general public can. This is useful for securing tokens at the initial listing price and preparing for strategies like volume growth.

ChartUp offers a **proprietary sniping method** that solves the limitations found in traditional approaches, such as those using JITO.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: **Sniping is completely optional.** You can choose to enable or skip this step during token launch.

#### How It Works

Sniping is **conditional** and occurs immediately after the liquidity pool is created, based on parameters you define.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: ChartUpâ€™s sniping method ensures execution before external snipers can affect price, while maintaining full control and stealth over your buys.

#### Advantages of Sniping

* **Guaranteed Initial Price**\
  Secure tokens at your desired price, avoiding slippage and front-running from public bots.
* **Ready for Volume Boosting Tasks**\
  Sniped tokens can be directly used to launch **volume boosting tasks**, giving your token immediate traction.

#### ChartUpâ€™s Sniping Method

ChartUp improves upon traditional JITO-style sniping with a more flexible and private system.

* **Up to 50 Wallets & Buy Transactions**\
  You can assign **up to 50 wallets** to perform buy transactions, giving you full flexibility in distribution.
* **Discreet Execution**\
  Buy transactions are **not linked to the LP creation**, making them harder to detect.
* **Wallet Control**\
  You choose the wallets used for sniping. Tokens are stored securely until you're ready to move or sell them.
