# Referrals

ChartUp offers a referral program that allows you to earn rewards by inviting new users. When a referred user places a paid volume order, you receive a reward share. Rewards are ongoing and continue for as long as the referred user remains active.

***

#### How It Works

* Referral rewards are calculated on a **per-task basis**.
* Each task completed by your referred user generates a reward of **0.1 SOL**.
* Example: A **$500K package** creates 6 tasks, resulting in a **0.6 SOL reward**.

***

#### Key Features

* **Recurring Rewards** â€” Earnings continue as long as your referred users place new orders.
* **No Caps or Expiry** â€” Rewards are lifetime-based for each referred user.
* **Instant Payouts** â€” Rewards are distributed automatically once an order is placed.

***

#### Best Practices

The referral program is most effective when shared with **active project owners** and **experienced Solana developers** who are likely to run ongoing volume strategies.\\

> ğŸ’¡ **Note**: all referral rewards are automated, transparent, and governed by the ChartUp [Terms & Conditions](https://www.chartup.io/terms-conditions?utm_source=chatgpt.com). ChartUp does not guarantee referral earnings; rewards depend entirely on the activity of your referred users.
